# Vacation ⋆｡°✩
## Here is how I created a web site, based on how my vacation went!
- In this website I used HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)!
#
- Before doing the HTML and CSS, I made a high-fidelity prototipe on Figma.

>These show how the web site will look like.

And these are the results!
